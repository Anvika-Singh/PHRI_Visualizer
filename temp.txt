Bag: TEMP

SUCCESS METRICS: TO BE WRITTEN 
Distance to goal, path length, time to reach goal, wall collisions, human collisions, timeouts, stalled time

QUALITY AND SOCIAL METRICS:
Minimum Distance: 2000000000.0m
Calculates the smallest distance between the robot and the human to see if it is within the 1 m collision radius

Total Acceleration: 16.0
Measures how smoothly the robot went. Lower is better.

Avg Movement Jerk: 0.00014229178709591355
Second order derivative of linear velocity to determine the jerkiness in the change of acceleration.

Path Irregularity Index: nan
Measures how much the robot deviates from the desired path to indicate how effiecient the path was. Lower the better
